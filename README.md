# Bitotsav17
Official android app for cultural fest Bitotsav 2017 of BIT Mesra.
The app provided various features such as details of events happening, quick updates via push notifications, offline experience, registration for students attending the fest, entry-tickets, purchase of fest t-shirts, and alumni support.

The app project relies in MVP architecture mixed with RxJava and a mix of managers. The UI was based on material design guidelines with smooth animations using custom views. It consumed a RESTful API using Retrofit and RxJava for fetching details of events, registrations and keeping track of student attending. Firebase was used for push notifications and NOSQL database Realm was used for caching to provide an offline experience and minimize network usage. Webviews with server-side validation was used for payments of entry-tickets, t-shirts and alumni support using ZUP payment SDK.
